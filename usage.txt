Usage


1. Very ecryptsfs module is loaded:
$ lsmod | grep ecryptfs
ecryptfs               89223  0 
$ 

If not add ecryptfs to /etc/modules

2. Create /etc/fstab entry:
/home/username/.secret /home/username/secret ecryptfs \
noauto,user,ecryptfs_fnek_sig=7c5d3dd8a1b49db0,\
ecryptfs_sig=7c5d3dd8a1b49db0,ecryptfs_cipher=aes,\
ecryptfs_key_bytes=32,ecryptfs_unlink_sigs 0 0

Some options to note:
o /home/username/.secret has encrypted data.
o /home/username/secret has decrypted data.
o The ecryptfs_fnek_sig option will be only listed if you enabled filename
  encryption
o The second last option ecryptfs_unlink_sigs ensures that the keyring is
  cleared every time the directory is un-mounted
o The bold options have been added:
o The user option enables to mount the directory as a user
o The noauto option is important, because otherwise systemd will error trying
  to mount the entry directly on boot.
o The user mount will default to option noexec.  If you want to have at least
  executable files in your private directory, you can add exec to the fstab
  options.
o The setup is now complete and directory should be mountable by the user.
